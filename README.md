Two Level Conditional Menu
==========================

This file is a wordpress plugin that takes a two-level menu of the normal, drop-down kind and converts it to a conditional one.

E.G.

Your menu structure looks like:

* Home
* About
    * People
		* History
* Contact
    * Phone
		* Email
		* Address

The sub-menu items would only appear on relevant pages. The 'People', and 'History' menu items would only appear on the 'About', 'People', and 'History' pages.
